Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Jean Claude Leonard C. Cueto, a fresh graduate in Computer Engineering. This repository showcases my personal and academic projects, skills, and work experience. It includes projects I developed during college such as my thesis project that is about a real-time student safety device and tasks I worked on during my internship. My goal is to highlight my knowledge in programming, embedded systems, and software development, and to provide a glimpse into my growth and passion for tech.
