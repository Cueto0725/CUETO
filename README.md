Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Jean Claude Leonard C. Cueto, a fresh graduate in Computer Engineering. This repository showcases my personal and academic projects, skills, and work experience. It includes projects I developed during college—such as a Bluetooth-controlled car chassis and a real-time student safety device—as well as projects and tasks I worked on during my internship. My goal is to highlight my knowledge in programming, embedded systems, and software development, and to provide a glimpse into my growth and passion for tech.
